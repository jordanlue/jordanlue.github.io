Hello! I'm Jordan. I'm a data analytics professional and I'm currently working as an Analytics Lead at Johnson & Johnson. I completed a Masters of Management Analytics from Queen's Smith School of Business, and a Bachelors of Applied Science in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto. I'm interested in data visualization, data science, and machine learning. This blog is a collection of thoughts and reflections along my journey as a data professional.
