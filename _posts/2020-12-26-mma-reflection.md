Throughout 2020, I completed the Queen's Master of Management Analytics (MMA), which is a 1 year full-time masters program offered to working and non-working students alike. As we close out the year, I reflect on my experiences as I begin to plan for what 2021 will hold, from a professional development standpoint. The Queen's MMA is a masters program with a focus on data and analytics.  I like to describe the experience as learning a combination of technical, non-technical and domain skills. 

For the **technical skills** we learned:

- Statistics
- Operations Research
- Programming: Python, R
- Machine Learning
- Big Data

For the **non-technical** skills, we learned:

- Teamwork
- Project Leadership
- Analytics Strategy and Change
- Negotiation
- Management
- AI & Ethics

For the **domain** skills, we learned:

* Operations & Supply Chain
* Marketing
* Financial Management
* Pricing

Entering the program, it was my goal to be able to learn as much as I could, given my passion for working with data, and desire to shape my career as an analytics professional. I came into the program, having significant experience with business intelligence and analytics, and have had the pleasure of leading my company through various analytics transformation efforts. I wanted to gain exposure to machine learning and predictive analytics, since I had limited exposure there. I also wanted to expand my awareness of tools and techniques and their applications in different domains. Lastly, I wanted to meet like-minded individuals who were on the same path as me and were just as passionate as I am about data. Did I achieve this? Mostly, yes! I summarize my thoughts on what I got out of the program below.

### Benefits of the Program

1. **You get a structured curriculum of curated content.** 

   In the world of analytics, it's true that a lot of content is available online and through MOOCs. However, the huge advantage of a nicely put together curriculum is the packaging around it and the way that it is taught. Having lectures, breakouts, and projects that reinforce the learning is very different from reading an article or watching a YouTube video. In addition, the information has been curated by active practitioners and experts in the field. When preparing your own curriculum, you sometimes don't know what you don't know, so it would be hard to plan for that.

2. **You learn a lot, and at a fast pace.**

   This is a full-time masters program, and the commitment to the schedule reflects that. In this program you cycle through 2 courses approximately every 2 months. This means that for every course, you are on your feet working on assignments immediately after the first class. The workload can be heavy, and gets even heavier depending on how far you decide to take your learning. There's also a wealth of additional reading material and textbooks. 

   There are many times where you are pushing to meet a deadline and without this pressure, when working a full-time job, it would be easy to let other things become your priority. Being enrolled in the program forces you to adjust your life to the program and lean fully into the learning experience. As an experienced analytics professional, I spent around 15-20 hours per week on the program, however, I could easily see that being pushed to ~25 hours if I didn't enter into the program already knowing a lot about analytics. 

3. **You are pushed to be uncomfortable and grow.**

   Queen's Smith School of Business is renown for it's ability to coach teamwork and management skills. In this program we were assigned to random groups of 7 and worked together on projects for the whole year. As the most experienced analytics individual, I found myself in a leadership position on the team, where my voice guided teammates both on approaching technical issues and also for organizing our efforts. Leadership is still relatively new to me, and this was a great learning opportunity. There's also ample opportunity to participate in class and develop presentation skills which are essential skills for a data professional.

### Downsides of the Program

1. **Remote learning - limited connections**

   At no fault of the school, I can't help but feel that we lost out on a significant and memorable experience we would have had with an in-person setting, if not for COVID-19. The first residential session was great because, although it had long days, we got to meet other classmates that we wouldn't normally interact with. The school had two more in-person residential sessions planned, but sitting through classes online for the whole day felt much longer without being able to chit-chat and network with other classmates. I did have significantly more time to spend on studying and projects though!

2. **Teamwork takes time and can lead to simplistic solutions**.

   As mentioned, we worked in teams quite extensively. Figuring out how to tackle a project often takes time and when you are limited on time, once you've set a path, the overhead to deviate from that path is too expensive due to all the interdependencies of the project's subtasks between members. Additionally, you also need to find a solution that all team members can agree on, and understand. This can mean that the solutions for projects can be quite linear and at a point of being just "good enough" to get the grade. On the other hand, with individual assignments, you have more flexibility, and can go deeper. So we can say we had a lot of opportunity for breadth (teamwork affords more resources) but less depth. 

3. **You might learn things you don't have an interest in**.

   After a while in the program,  you start to realize which topics you would like to see more of, and which topics you have no interest in. Although I mentioned this as a benefit, it's also a con. I started to realize that I wanted to learn more depth about machine learning, and found myself caring less about some topics that came up. Nevertheless, every course is the same length, with similar workload - and so I found myself begrudgingly going through the motions to get through those topics that I cared less about.

### Bottom-line 

Overall, I am quite proud of this accomplishment and also the habits I put forth during the year. I made sure to work or study almost every single day throughout the year, and I believe this was reflected in what I was able to achieve with the team. I learned a tremendous amount, and this helped me to be able to further define where I want to go with my career: I would like to be able to go deeper into the Machine Learning and Big Data subject areas. I wish that this program could have been delivered in-person, as I believe I would have been able to get to know other classmates better, but unfortunately, that was out of anyone's control this year. For those current or aspiring data professionals, consider that this program tries to teach you many things at once. I would recommend it generally, although if you have a specific focus such as data science, or data engineering *alone*, or if you find yourself reviewing the curriculum and not resonating with more than ~30% of the courses, then you might consider a more specialized program.  

### Next Steps

Although the program taught a lot of content, there is only so much that you can absorb in 1 year. The next steps are to look into the areas I want to learn more about, and revisit some of the textbooks that I didn't have a chance to get into. We also didn't learn a lot about deep learning. My list of items to either revisit or learn more about include:

- Machine Learning Algorithms Review

- Deep Learning

- Experimentation

- Big Data

- Python: Data Structures & Algorithms
